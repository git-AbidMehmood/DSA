"""10. Container With Most Water
 You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n
 vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are
 (i, 0) and (i, height[I]).
 Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such
 that the container contains the most water.
 Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 Output: 49
 Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by an array
 [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section)
 the container can contain is 49.
